### Atonal 3D synth experiment

This three-dimensional synth creates atonal, horrifying soundscapes. Every vertex is an oscillator. 

Code is sort of a mess as this was done quickly for my own purposes. Feel free to fork and develop the idea further if you will! Uses Three.js (r.79) library and Web Audio API.
